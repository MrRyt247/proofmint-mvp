# ProofMint Frontend Implementation

## ðŸŽ‰ Frontend Complete!

I've successfully built the ProofMint frontend by replacing the default Scaffold-ETH 2 boilerplate with custom pages based on the designs in the `display/desktop-view/` folder.

## ðŸš€ What's Been Built

### Pages Created:

1. **Landing Page** (`/`) - Hero section with ProofMint branding, features showcase, and call-to-action buttons
2. **Sign In** (`/signin`) - Authentication page with email/password and wallet connect options
3. **Sign Up** (`/signup`) - Registration form with validation and terms acceptance
4. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Main user interface with sidebar navigation, stats cards, quick actions, and recent proofs table
5. **Create Proof** (`/create`) - Multi-step proof creation flow with type selection and file upload
6. **Verify Proof** (`/verify`) - Proof verification interface with search functionality and detailed results
7. **Notifications** (`/notifications`) - Notification center with filtering, settings, and interactive elements
8. **User Profile** (`/profile`) - Comprehensive profile management with tabs for personal info, security, and preferences

### Key Features Implemented:

- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, professional design using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI components
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Interactive Components**: Forms, modals, dropdowns, toggles, and navigation
- **State Management**: Local state handling for forms and UI interactions
- **Wallet Integration**: Uses wagmi hooks for Web3 wallet connectivity
- **Mock Data**: Realistic sample data for demonstrations
- **Navigation**: Seamless routing between pages with proper breadcrumbs

## ðŸ”§ Development Server

The frontend is currently running at:

- **Local**: http://localhost:3000
- **Network**: http://10.0.2.15:3000

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

To complete the ProofMint MVP, you may want to:

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to actual smart contracts and APIs
2. **Web3 Functionality**: Implement actual proof creation and verification on blockchain
3. **File Upload**: Add IPFS integration for document storage
4. **Authentication**: Implement proper user authentication system
5. **Database**: Connect to a database for user profiles and proof metadata
6. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
7. **Deployment**: Deploy to production environment

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

The design closely follows the mockups from `display/desktop-view/` while adding:

- Interactive elements that weren't visible in static designs
- Mobile responsiveness
- Loading states and error handling
- Form validation and user feedback
- Consistent navigation and branding

The color scheme, typography, and overall aesthetic match the intended ProofMint brand identity as a professional, trustworthy platform for decentralized identity verification.
